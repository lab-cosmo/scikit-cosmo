scikit-cosmo documentation
===========================

``scikit-cosmo`` is a collection of `scikit-learn <https://scikit.org/>`_
compatible utilities that implement methods developed in the `COSMO laboratory
<https://cosmo.epfl.ch>`_.

Convenient-to-use libraries such as scikit-learn have accelerated the adoption and application
of machine learning (ML) workflows and data-driven methods. Such libraries have gained great
popularity partly because the implemented methods are generally applicable in multiple domains.
While developments in the atomistic learning community have put forward general-use machine
learning methods, their deployment is commonly entangled with domain-specific functionalities,
preventing access to a wider audience.

scikit-COSMO targets domain-agnostic implementations of methods developed in the
computational chemical and materials science community, following the
scikit-learn API and coding guidelines to promote usability and interoperability
with existing workflows. scikit-COSMO contains a toolbox of methods for
unsupervised and supervised analysis of ML datasets, including the comparison,
decomposition, and selection of features and samples.
